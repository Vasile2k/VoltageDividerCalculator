#Voltage Divider Resistor Value Calculator

A very simple tool if you're too lazy to search values yourself. Just type in input voltage, output voltage and how close you want to be.

For example, if you say input voltage 5, output 3.3 and approximation to be 10 this program will find all possible values from standard resistors to make a voltage divider with 5 volts input and 3.3 Â± 10% volts output.

##Why?

Because.
